# List of things to do
## Second official release:
These things are features and fixes I'd like to get completed for the second major release (v0.2.0) of Curly.
- Make aggregate types work without type aliasing them first
- Match expressions
- Product types
- Span
- See github issues

## Third official release
These things are features and fixes I'd like to get completed for the third major release (v0.3.0) of Curly.
- Intersection types
- Generics
- Mutability
- Laziness
- `?`/`!` operators
- Lists
- Strings (which are basically just lists of chars)

## Future releases
These things are features and fixes I'd like to get completed in some point in the far future. Although these features are desired, they are not a priority due to either their complexity or dependencies. These are not in any particular order, and will be moved into an appropriate release when decided upon. These features, however, will be necessary to implement before an official v1.0.0.
- Standard library
- Overridable operators
- Iterators
- For loops
- IO
- Bindings with C

## Things in the far future
These things are goals that will take months, if not years, to even start due to either their complexity or dependencies.
- Package manager (written in Curly)
- Bootstraped compiler
- Optimisations
- Debugger
